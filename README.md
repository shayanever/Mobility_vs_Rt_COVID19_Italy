Analysis Overview
The notebook follows these steps:

Data Loading: Load the mobility and Rt datasets for Italy during the COVID-19 period.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize trends in mobility and Rt values.
Correlation Analysis: Apply statistical methods to find the correlation between mobility data and Rt.
Isolation Forest Outlier Detection: Use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in mobility patterns during the pandemic.
Other Analyses: Additional insights using various statistical and visualization techniques (such as linear regression, time series analysis, etc.).
Conclusion: Summarize the findings on how mobility patterns influenced the spread of COVID-19.
Results
The analysis includes a correlation study between mobility and Rt, as well as the identification of outliers in mobility data using Isolation Forest. These outliers may correspond to critical shifts in mobility during key moments in the pandemic.

Future Work
Use machine learning models to predict Rt based on mobility and other variables.
Explore data from different countries to compare mobility and Rt correlations.
Extend the analysis to other pandemic-related metrics and refine outlier detection.
